## Creating a page

Before you can begin creating your form's content, you need to create a page to hold it. All forms need at least one page, but you can have as many pages as you require.

When you first create a new form, you will need to add your first page by clicking the 'add' button in the top right corner.

Now, you can begin to populate your empty page with items.

Note that page logic can contain only visibility rules.
