# Unique identifiers

## Quick Summary

* An item's (Request) ID is a unique variable name that ensures each Dialob item (question, list item, field, etc.) has a unique identifier across a Dialog session
* Requests consist of two parts: Request Type (string, boolean, number, etc.) and meta data (e.g. the question the user will be responding to on the filling side)
* Group, response (question), and Note IDs can be changed by clicking on their current ID in the top left corner of the item window
* Page IDs can be changed by clicking on the hamburger icon next to their names

## Overview 

All Dialob elements have globally unique identifiers:

* Dialog ID
* Page ID
* Group ID
* Input ID
* Output ID

The Dialog ID can be found in the Dialog Options/Information window, accessible from the upper menu.

The IDs for all other items can be seen in the top left corner of the items themselves. See example:

## What is a Request? {#what-is-request}

The main variable used in DEL is a special meta variable called **Request**. A Request is the meta variable used to gather (form user) input defined as **Response**.

A Request consists of two parts:

* **Request type**: Defines how user input is gathered. For example, a Text type will gather responses by the user in the form of text and return a String, whereas Integer type will gather numbers and return an Integer.  In other words, the request type is the type of data that a question will return; for example, a number, a paragraph, or an address.

* **Request meta data**: Contains a hint/rubric/question describing what it wants the form user to do. Examples of a request include prompts such as "What is your name?" Take a picture” or “Select from the list”.  This can be thought of as the question prompt for the user to answer. 

See example below of a request type, request meta data, and a validation rule:

DEL also allows the defining of variables without binding to a Request, for example, [context variables](https://docs.dialob.io/dialob-variables/), and it also permits the creation of new types of variables.

## Request IDs and rules for writing them {#request-id-rules}

Request IDs (unique variable names) are automatically generated by Dialob Composer to speed up the development process and to ensure that each Request has a unique ID by default. The user can change them as desired, and user-defined Request IDs uniqueness is automatically checked in near real time. Dialob Composer’s built-in ID notation check is based on the following naming conventions:

* The request ID must start with letter [a-z,A-Z]
* It can be followed by a number [0-9]
* It cannot be any reserved name (logical operators, comparison operators etc.)
* It must be unique. This is automatically checked by Dialob.
* Request IDs are case-sensitive. E.g. _firstname_ is not the same as _Firstname_.
* All of the changes to existing Request IDs are automatically updated by Dialob Composer. This ensures that the previously-created control logic with DEL remains correct and up-to-date.

## How to change an ID {#change-id}

Changing an ID will update all references to this ID automatically.

### Page ID

The Page ID can be changed by clicking the hamburger icon to the right of the Page name and selecting "Change ID" from the dropdown.


### Group ID, Question ID, Note ID

These can all be changed simply by clicking on their current IDs in the top left corner of the items and creating a new ID.


If a new ID conflicts with an existing one, the ID editing field will turn red, and a new ID will not be set until the naming conflict is resolved.
