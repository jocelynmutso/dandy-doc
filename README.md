### General explanation of how naming works



### How to order menu item groups (Main Topics) and content menu items (Subtopics)



### How to make spaces between words in Main Topic and Subtopic names**

To make spaces between words in Main Topic names, insert an underscore between words in the folder name. The underscore will be ignored by the renderer.

Example folder name: basic_operations 
How it's rendered: Basic Operations

To make spaces between words in Subtopic names, use an underscore between the words of the Subtopic's markdown file name. The underscore will be ignored by the renderer.

Example markdown file name: advanced_operations.md  
How it's rendered: Advanced Operations
