## Overview

Items consist of structures (groups), inputs, and outputs.  

There are two ways to add a new item:

1. **To create a new item WITHIN a group**: Use the "Add Item" button in the bottom left corner of a group. 
2. **To create a new item OUTSIDE of a group**: Use the hamburger icon in the top right corner of a page or group and select "Insert new"

## Creating a new item WITHIN a group: Use the 'Add Item' button

Using the 'Add Item' button at the bottom left corner of a group will create a new item within that particular group. See example below:

Select text input type and write a label.

On the filling side, we see that our text input with the label "I am inside group 1" appears within group1.

## Creating a new item OUTSIDE of a group: Use the hamburger icon + 'Insert New'

Creating a new item with the hamburger icon + "Insert New" from **within a group** will create a new item **below and outside** of the group. See example below:

First, we add an input of type `text`.

![Insert new](basicoperations/insert-new.png)

We add a label to `text1`.

![Insert new](basicoperations/insert-new2.png)

On the filling side, we see that the `text1` with the label "I am outside of group 1" appears outside of Group1 but still inside Page1.
