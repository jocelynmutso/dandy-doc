# Text and Textbox types

## Quick Summary

* The only difference between them is how they are rendered on the filling side

## Overview  

Both text and textbox return text (string) values. There is no length difference between the maximum text length for either of these. 

The only difference between them is how they appear on the filling side.

* **Text**: A single-line text field
* **Textbox**: A multi-line text field

On the Composer side, they both look the same:
