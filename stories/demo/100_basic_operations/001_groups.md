## Overview

Groups exist within pages. They serve to organise different types of questions into logical groups and have slightly different functionalities depending on their type.

There are four types of groups:

* Group (general)  
* Survey Group
* Survey Group (vertical)
* Multi-row Group   

All groups can contain other groups (nested groups), inputs, and outputs (note type). Inputs or outputs can be created both inside and outside of groups.

Only visibility logic rules can be applied to groups

## Group Use Cases 


### Group (general)

This is the most basic type of group. It can be used to nest other groups or simply to logically organise inputs and outputs.

### Survey Group

A survey group is used to create survey-style questions.  It usually contains **Survey Items** and a **List**.  In this type of group, survey radio buttons are arranged horozontally across the screen on the filling side.

### Survey Group (vertical)

A vertical survey group is used to create survey-style questions.  A vertical survey group can contain **Survey Items** and a **List**.  In this type of group, survey radio buttons are arranged vertically across the screen on the filling side.

### Multi-row Group

This type of group is used when multiple inputs are required, for example, when collecting a client's first, middle, and last names as independent inputs. 

A multi-row group can contain any combination of different inputs.
